A simple SpringMVC HelloWorld app.
A Html/JSP/JavaScript client, talks to a Spring-DI enabled server with a simplistic Controller/Service/DAO design.
The app is tested using JUnit, FEST assertions and Selenium.
The app's functionality is deliberately simplistic, but is useful as a template to bootstrap more complex apps.
